R Universe is a project by rOpenSci that experiments with ideas for improving the publication and discover of research software in R. It builds Wasm binaries for R packages for use in webR applications. So for your custom R packages, the easiest wy to get up and running is to create a personal R-Universe repo for your packages. The system will automatically build R package binaries for different targets including WebAssembly, which can be used in webR or QuartoLive. There are other options, such as the rwasm package."

    "text": "Use cases\n\nShare interactive reports and dashboards with executable code\nCreate and distribute interactive, reproducible documentation\nR-based submissions of clinical trial data to regulatory bodies for review\nTeaching and learning\n\n\nwebR can provide a smooth, interactive, immediate introduction to the world of working with data in R. Users who haven’t had the chance to use R due to barriers raised by software installation or cloud-based service registration can still be introduced to R thanks to interactive examples powered by webR. And in terms of reproducibility, you can have reproducible statistics through containerization and notebook-style literate programming. The R Consortium Submissions Group champions improved practices of R in clinical trial research, and thanks to Shinylive, they have successfully submitted a pilot R Shiny app featuing Shinylive to the FDA to review. In terms of educational benefits, say you’re giving an intro to R workshop, you can dive into code without software. You can remix examples on the fly. You can have tactile educational content with interactive experimentation, reduced context switching, no more switching between console and tutorial, making the learning process more streamlined and engaging. This is also helpful for academics who want to service apps to hundreds of people but do not have the computational load available to them."
